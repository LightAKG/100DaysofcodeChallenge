Queue is a data structure in which things are arrange in a line.
There are two main components of Queue, Front and rear
FIFO(first in first out)

there are two deque in queue
1. Deque = double ended queue
2. Dequeue = remove from the queue

Operations in Queue
1. Enque (Add operation)
2. Dequeue (Remove )
3. Front (Peek)

we can implement queue with the help of 

1. Array(its more hectic)
Queue using Array -> fixed size
add - O(1)
remove - O(n)
Front - O(1)

2. Circular queue using Array
imp - Rear++
     Rear = (Rear + 1) % size;

3. Implementing queue with the help of linked list
